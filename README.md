## Features
* Play/Stop videos through the browser - Also mobile browser compatible
* All hotkeys from omxplayer mapped to the webpage
* Multilanguage
* Permanent playlist - Just add folders and streams
* Search for filenames with wildcards
* Autoplay next video
* Mark of already viewed videos

## Requirements
`sudo apt-get install php5-cli`

## Run
To create a simple php webserver listening on port 4321, you can change the port to whatever you want.

`php -S 0.0.0.0:4321 -t YOURPATHTOOMXWEBGUIFOLDER > /dev/null 2>&1 &`

Open the page with http://IPTOYOURPI:4321

## Autostart
Add the following line to crontab with `sudo crontab -e` to start the simple php webserver on reboot

`@reboot php -S 0.0.0.0:4321 -t YOURPATHTOOMXWEBGUIFOLDER > /dev/null 2>&1 &`

## Troubleshooting
* Permissions for files and folders:
Make sure that the root folder and the folder "tmp", where you have installed the omxwebgui, have the rights CHMOD 777. For example you install it under `/home/pi/omxwebgui` than the folder `/home/pi/omxwebgui` and `/home/pi/omxwebgui/tmp` need chmod 777. If that does not work for try to set all files and folders to 777 but that shouldn't be necessary. 
* If you using a own webserver that runs under `www-data` and you have some `/dev/vchiq` permission problems than you need to run `sudo usermod -a -G video www-data` to give that `www-data` user the correct permissions (thx to Sergio). More information here: http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/19436/how-can-i-permanently-fix-dev-vchiq-permission-errors
* If you are using a webserver maybe you need to set the owner of the files and folder to `www-data` if you have permission errors
